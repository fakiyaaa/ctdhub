## Evaluation criteria
1. Coach and Talent development database with opportunities

-  It will make life's of college students from minerva much easier by just scrolling all the data through phone. -  It's time-consuming to open it through platform that we have now
-  People can not access all the opportunities

Story: How compelling is the story around this app once completed?
- they will easily access all the information/opportunities/internships through app
Market: How large or unique is the market for this app?
- only Minerva University students
- 
Habit: How habit-forming or addictive is this app?

- 2-3 times in a week (based on my usage of current platform)
- 
Scope: How well-formed is the scope for this app?

- I would need to link all the provided information from the Notion page, and transmit it to the application.




2. App to keep track of school assignments and sort by classes etc.


Mobile: How uniquely mobile is the product experience?

- we only have instagram pages with opportunities/events in Almaty, so it is a good idea to implement an app


Story: How compelling is the story around this app once completed?
- citizens of almaty would easily access it and us eit on a daily basis


Market: How large or unique is the market for this app?
- it is only dedicated to citizens on almaty, but once it will become popular other cities from kazakhstan will start to implement it


Habit: How habit-forming or addictive is this app?
- person would open the app, if they would have no ideas on visiting places/restaurants/events


Scope: How well-formed is the scope for this app?
 - i think it would be moderately hard to keep track of all events. so maybe focusing specifically on restaurants/cafes or events/concerts. 



My final idea is: Coach and Talent development database with opportunities
